PDF Tools is, among other things, a replacement of DocView for PDF files. The key difference is that pages are not pre-rendered by e.g. ghostscript and stored in the file-system, but rather created on-demand and stored in memory.

This rendering is performed by a special library named, for whatever reason, ~poppler~, running inside a server program. This program is called ~epdfinfo~ and its job is to successively read requests from Emacs and produce the proper results, i.e. the PNG image of a PDF page.

Actually, displaying PDF files is just one part of ~pdf-tools~. Since ~poppler~ can provide us with all kinds of information about a document and is also able to modify it, there is a lot more we can do with it. [[https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2bc1is][Watch this video for a detailed demo!]]

Installing this package via NonGNU ELPA or MELPA or any of the other package managers is straightforward and should just work.
~pdf-tools~ requires a server ~epdfinfo~ to run against, which it will try to compile and build when it is activated for the first time.

You should not require any manual changes. The documentation below is *only if you are installing from source*, or for troubleshooting / debugging purposes.

:END:
If you install ~pdf-tools~ via NonGNU ELPA or MELPA, *you don't need to worry about this separate server installation at all*.  However, if you have a non-standard installation, please refer to the links below for installing ~epdfinfo~ server prerequisites.

Note: You'll need GNU Emacs \ge 26.1 and some form of a GNU/Linux OS. Other operating systems are not officially supported, but ~pdf-tools~ is known to work on many of them.

Similarly, package-managers are not officially supported, but ~pdf-tools~ is known to be available on some of them. See the section on [[id:fb5cef15-fed4-4dec-a443-52f7c00c7831][Installing the ~epdfinfo~ server from package managers]] to avoid manual installation of server / server prerequisites.

See the section on [[id:A34704B9-1B51-4614-8806-C4059F7B42D5][I want to add support for ~pdf-tools~ on =My Fav OS=. How do I do that?]] to add your favorite Operating System to this list.

*** Installing ~epdfinfo~ Server Prerequisites on a Debian-based system
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
First make sure a suitable build-system is installed. We need at least a C compiler (~gcc~), ~make~, ~automake~ and ~autoconf~.

Next we need to install a few libraries ~pdf-tools~ depends on, some of which are probably already on your system.

#+begin_src sh
  $ sudo apt install libpng-dev zlib1g-dev libpoppler-glib-dev
#+end_src

On some older Ubuntu systems, the final command will possibly give an error. This should be no problem, since in some versions this package was contained in the main package ~libpoppler-dev~. Also note, that ~zlib1g-dev~ was for a long time called ~libz-dev~, which it still may be on your system.

Debian wheezy comes with ~libpoppler~ version ~0.18~, which is pretty old. The minimally required version is ~0.16~, but some features of ~pdf-tools~ depend on a more recent version of this library. See the following table for what they are and what version they require.

| You want to ...                           | Required version |
|-------------------------------------------+------------------|
| ... create and modify text annotations.   | \ge 0.19.4       |
| ... search case-sensitive.                | \ge 0.22         |
| ... create and modify markup annotations. | \ge 0.26         |
|-------------------------------------------+------------------|

In case you decide to install ~libpoppler~ from source, make sure to run its configure script with the ~--enable-xpdf-headers~ option.

Finally there is one feature (following links of a PDF document by plain keystrokes) which requires imagemagick's convert utility. This requirement is optional and you may install it like so:
#+begin_src sh
  $ sudo apt install imagemagick
#+end_src
*** Installing ~epdfinfo~ Server Prerequisites On macOS

:END:
Although macOS is not officially supported, it has been reported that ~pdf-tools~ works well on macOS. You will need to install ~poppler~ which you can get with Homebrew via
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ brew install poppler automake
#+END_SRC

You will also have to help ~pkg-config~ find some libraries by setting ~PKG_CONFIG_PATH~. ~brew~ will show you which paths need to be added to ~PKG_CONFIG_PATH~ during the installation process. Make sure you export the paths to the env variable, eg:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}:$(brew --prefix libffi)/lib/pkgconfig/:/usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.8/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig"
#+END_SRC
or likewise within Emacs using ~setenv~.

After that, compilation should proceed as normal.

:END:
Although not officially supported, it has been reported that ~pdf-tools~ work well on FreeBSD. Instead of building ~pdf-tools~, you can install one of the OS packages with e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ pkg install pdf-tools-emacs26
#+END_SRC

To see the current list of ~pdf-tools~ packages for FreeBSD visit [[https://repology.org/metapackages/?search=pdf-tools&inrepo=freebsd][the Repology list]].

To build ~pdf-tools~ from either MELPA or directly from the source repository, install the dependencies with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ pkg install autotools gmake poppler-glib
#+END_SRC

If you choose not to install from MELPA, you must substitute ~gmake~ for ~make~ in the instructions below.

~pdf-tools~ can be built and used on Windows using the MSYS2 compiler, or pre-built binaries can be installed in MSYS2.

The pre-built binaries will work with native (not Cygwin) Windows builds of Emacs. They include the standard binaries provided by the GNU project, those available as MSYS2 packages and numerous third-party binaries. Refer to the appropriate section under [[id:e305cd0a-e798-4c2b-af27-21bcd936c1c9][Installing the ~epdfinfo~ server]] for more details.

~pdf-tools~ will successfully compile using Cygwin, but it will not be able to open PDFs properly due to the way binaries compiled with Cygwin handle file paths.

Note that this is the only officially supported method for installing the ~epdfinfo~ binary. Instructions:

#+begin_src sh
    $ cd /path/to/pdf-tools
    $ make -s
#+end_src

This should compile the source code and create a Emacs Lisp Package in the root directory of the project. The configure script also tells you at the very end, which features, depending on the ~libpoppler~ version, will be available. These commands should give no error, otherwise you are in trouble.

If using the GNU binaries for Windows, support for PNG and ~zlib~ must first be installed by copying the appropriate dlls into emacs' ~bin/~ directory. Most third-party binaries come with this already done.

First, [[https://www.msys2.org/][install MSYS2]] and update the package database and core packages using the instructions provided. Then, to compile ~pdf-tools~ itself:

1. Open msys2 shell
2. Update and install dependencies, skipping any you already have
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ pacman -Syu
   $ pacman -S base-devel
   $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
   $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib
   $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libpng
   $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-poppler
   $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-imagemagick
   #+END_SRC
3. Install ~pdf-tools~ in Emacs, but do not try to compile the server. Instead, get a separate copy of the source somewhere else.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools
   #+END_SRC
4. Open ~mingw64~ shell (*Note:* You must use ~mingw64.exe~ and not ~msys2.exe~)
5. Compile pdf-tools
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ cd /path/to/pdf-tools
   $ make -s
   #+END_SRC
6. This should produce a file ~server/epdfinfo.exe~. Copy this file into the ~pdf-tools/~ installation directory in your Emacs.
7. Start Emacs and activate the package.
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   M-x pdf-tools-install RET
   #+END_SRC
8. Test.
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   M-x pdf-info-check-epdfinfo RET
   #+END_SRC

If this is successful, ~(pdf-tools-install)~ can be added to Emacs' config. See the note on how to set up PATH in the previous section.

Package maintained at: https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs-pdf-tools-server?repo=mingw64

Users installing Emacs from the MSYS2 distribution can install pre-built binaries of the ~epdfinfo~ server.

1. [[https://www.msys2.org/][Install MSYS2]] and update the package database and core packages using the instructions provided.
2. Install packages: ~pacman -Ss mingw-w64-x86_64-{emacs,emacs-pdf-tools-server,imagemagick}~ (ImageMagick is optional, see above.)
3. Make sure Emacs can find ~epdfinfo.exe~. Either add the MINGW install location (e.g. ~C:/msys2/mingw64/bin~) to the system path with ~setx PATH "C:\msys2\mingw64\bin;%PATH%"~ or set Emacs's path with ~(setenv "PATH" (concat "C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin;" (getenv "PATH")))~. Note that libraries from other GNU utilities, such as Git for Windows, may interfere with those needed by ~pdf-tools~. ~pdf-info-check-epdinfo~ will succeed, but errors occur when trying to view a PDF file. This can be fixed by ensuring that the MSYS libraries are always preferred.
4. Add ~(pdf-tools-install)~ to your Emacs config.

This package depends on the following Elisp packages, which should be installed before installing the ~pdf-tools~ package.
| Package   | Required version                 |
|-----------+----------------------------------|
| [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/let-alist.html][let-alist]] | >= 1.0.4 (comes with Emacs 25.2) |

If ~make~ produced the ELP file ~pdf-tools-${VERSION}.tar~ you are fine. This package contains all the necessary files for Emacs and may be installed by either using
#+begin_src sh
    $ make install-package
#+end_src
or executing the Emacs command
#+begin_src elisp
  M-x package-install-file RET pdf-tools-${VERSION}.tar RET
#+end_src

To complete the installation process, you need to activate the package by putting the code below somewhere in your ~.emacs~.  Alternatively, and if you care about startup time, you may want to use the loader version instead.
#+begin_src elisp
  (pdf-tools-install)  ; Standard activation command
  (pdf-loader-install) ; On demand loading, leads to faster startup time
#+end_src

Once the Installation process is complete, check out [[id:19a3daea-6fa6-4ac3-9201-d2034c46ad8c][Easy Help for PDF Tools features]] and [[id:8dccd685-18b8-4c98-977a-0fe2d66b724c][Configuring PDF Tools features]] to get started!

Some day you might want to update this package via ~git pull~ and then reinstall it. Sometimes this may fail, especially if Lisp-Macros are involved and the version hasn't changed. To avoid this kind of problems, you should delete the old package via ~list-packages~, restart Emacs and then reinstall the package.

This also applies when updating via package and MELPA.

Autorevert works by polling the file-system every ~auto-revert-interval~ seconds, optionally combined with some event-based reverting via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/File-Notifications.html][file notification]]. But this currently does not work reliably, such that Emacs may revert the PDF-buffer while the corresponding file is still being written to (e.g. by LaTeX), leading to a potential error.

With a recent [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]] installation, you might want to put the following somewhere in your dotemacs, which will revert the PDF-buffer *after* the TeX compilation has finished.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

You can go to the ~pdf-tools~ folder and run ~make test~ to run the ERT tests and check if the changes you have made to the code break any of the tests.

The tests are written in ERT, which is the built-in testing system in Emacs. However, they are run using ~Cask~ which you will have to install first, if you don't have it already. You can install ~Cask~ by following the instructions on their site at https://github.com/cask/cask

I'm working on automating ~pdf-tools~ installation as much as possible, in order to improve the installation experience. If you want to add support for a new / currently unsupported Operating System, please modify the ~server/autobuild~ script. Say you want to support a new Operating System called MyFavOS. You need to do the following work:

1. Add a call to ~os_myfavos~ under ~handle-options~ at the end of the existing call chain. Here we try and pick up the correct Operating System and install the relevant dependencies.
2. Add handling for the ~--os~ argument in ~os_argument~ for ~myfavos~, so that the appropriate function can be called to install pre-requisites. ~--os~ is the argument that we pass to the script from the command-line to indicate which OS we are on.
3. Create a ~os_myfavos~ function. This function checks if we are running on MyFavOS. If we are running on MyFavOS, it sets up ~PKGCMD~, ~PKGARGS~ and ~PACKAGES~ variables so that the appropriate package manager can install the dependencies as part of the rest of the ~autobuild~ script.

The idea here is to make the ~server/autobuild~ file the single place from which installation can happen on any Operating System. This makes building ~pdf-tools~ dead simple via the ~Makefile~.

This seems like a lot of work, but it is not. If you need a reference, search for ~os_gentoo~ or ~os_debian~ in the ~server/autobuild~ file and see how these are setup and used. The functions are used to install dependencies on Gentoo and Debian respectively, and are simple to copy / change.

When you make your changes, be sure to test them!

  Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
#+end_example

This happens because M1 architecture is =ARM64=, whereas the Emacs App you are using has been compiled for the =x86_64= architecture. The way to solve this problem is to install a version of Emacs which has been compiled for the M1. As of today, [2022-05-09 Mon], the latest version of Emacs available on https://emacsformacosx.com/ is natively compiled and you will not face these issues on it. Please remove your current Emacs App and install it from https://emacsformacosx.com/.

Thank you.

PS: How do I know if the Emacs I'm running has been compiled correctly?

You can see this by opening the =Activity Monitor=, selecting =Emacs=, clicking on the =Info= key, and then clicking on =Sample=. The =Code Type= field in the Sample output will show you how your Application has been compiled. Here is the output for EmacsForMacOSX (you can see that it's =ARM64=):
#+begin_example
  Sampling process 61824 for 3 seconds with 1 millisecond of run time between samples
  Sampling completed, processing symbols...
  Analysis of sampling Emacs-arm64-11 (pid 61824) every 1 millisecond

#+end_example

If your Emacs is compiled for x86, the =Code Type= will be =x86_64=.
