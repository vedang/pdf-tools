;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode for pdf-tools introduces standard-Emacs-like concepts of
;; point, mark, region, and cursor into pdf-tools and uses these to implement
;; keyboard-based navigation, selection, and annotation in pdf files.

;; Point is a special position on a pdf page. For simplicity, it is referred to
;; by an integer 'i', but point is at 'i' actually means that point is at the
;; midpoint of the left edge of the bounding rectangle of the character with
;; index 'i' in the list of characters and character boundaries on the current
;; pdf page. Mark is defined in the same way. The buffer-local variable
;; `pdf-keynav-charlayout' is this list of characters and character boundaries.
;; `pdf-keynav-point' stores point in terms of an index in it, while
;; `pdf-keynav-mark' does the same for mark. The region is the area of (the
;; bounding rectangles of) the characters between mark and point. Finally, the
;; cursor visually indicates point by highlighting the character at whose
;; bounding rectangles left-edge midpoint it is.

;; Bugs:

;; On at least some builds of Emacs version 29.0.50, but not on 28.1, there is
;; a bug where `frame-parameters' are not updated when resizing a frame. This
;; causes the cursor to be wrongly displayed when
;; `pdf-keynav-pointer-as-cursor-minor-mode' is non-nil. A workaround is to run
;; `make-frame' after resizing and closing the old frame.

;; There is a bug in poppler versions 21.03.0-21.07.0 which often causes the
;; alignment between character boundaries and characters to break, which in
;; turn breaks the character-based commands in this minor mode (but not the
;; commands that rely only on the charlayout). In more recent versions of
;; poppler such misalignment is very rare. While `pdf-keynav-charlayout'
;; contains characters in addition to character boundaries, for convenience
;; this code mainly uses `pdf-keynav-text' to access text; both do ultimately
;; rely on `poppler_page_get_text', but the former may be truncated when there
;; is misalignment.

;; The movement commands relating to characters, lines, textregions,
;; paragraphs, and pages rely only on the rectangles in the page charlayout for
;; their functioning, while the movement commands relating to regexes, words,
;; and sentences also require that the charlayout elements are matched to the
;; correct characters.

;; Performance:

;; Since that's how things are currently done in pdf-tools, this minor mode
;; displays the region and cursor by rendering them together with the whole pdf
;; page as one png image which is then displayed in Emacs. This makes things
;; inherently slow.

;; When enabling `pdf-keynav-pointer-as-cursor-minor-mode', the mouse pointer
;; is co-opted to function as a cursor. Like this redrawing the whole page
;; image can be avoided when updating the cursor position, resulting in
;; considerable performance gains.

;; On certain machines with high-resolution displays and `pdf-view-use-scaling'
;; non-nil, the navigation commands provided here may be considerably slower.
;; Other things that negatively influence the performance are
;; `pdf-keynav-transient-mark-mode', `pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode', a high
;; zoom level, and anything else that makes page updates more frequent or more
;; computationally expensive.

;; Keyboard navigation would also be slower if each command were too directly
;; interface with epdfinfo and poppler to get the necessary pdf page elements.
;; This is why they are loaded once per page and stored in buffer locals.
;; However, loading these buffer locals at each page change makes scrolling
;; across pages slow, which is why by default they are only loaded for the
;; current page when a command is first used that needs them. See
;; `pdf-keynav-lazy-load'.

;; TODO:

;; Maybe an idle timer for lazy loading of page-specific buffer-locals.

;; Recommended settings outside this minor mode:

;; Set pdf-annot-minor-mode-map-prefix to a single key (like "a" or "m").

(defvar-local pdf-keynav-charlayout nil
  "List of characters on current page with their bounding rectangles.

Each element is of the form (CHAR (LEFT TOP RIGHT BOT)).

CHAR is a character (represented by an integer in elisp; (string CHAR) gives
its string representation).

LEFT, TOP, RIGHT, and BOT are relative coordinates in a coordinate system with
the origin at the top left corner of the pdf page, the x-axis horizontally to
the right, and the y-axis vertically down:

LEFT is the x-coordinate of the left edge of the bounding rectangle,
TOP is the y-coordinate of its top edge,
RIGHT is the x-coordinate of the right edge,
BOT is the y-coordinate of its bottom edge.

Expressed differently, (LEFT TOP RIGHT BOT) = (X1 Y1 X2 Y2), where (X1, Y1) are
the coordinates of the left-top vertex of the characters bounding rectangle and
(X2, Y2) are the coordinates of the right-bottom vertex.

Each x-coordinate is expressed as a fraction of (that is, relative to) the
total page width and each y-coordinate as a fraction of to the total page
height.

This variable is the basis of most commands in pdf-keynav. It is constructed by
calling `pdf-info-charlayout' which in turn calls the C command
`cmd_charlayout' defined in epdfinfo.c. `cmd_charlayout' just combines the
characters returned by `poppler_page_get_text' with the charregions returned by
`poppler_page_get_text_layout', both of which are part of the glib frontend/API
of poppler (see the poppler glib documentation).

In poppler, characters bounding boxes (charregions) normally have the same
height within a line (that is TOP and BOT are the same), but their widths
differ.")

REGION will usually be the charregion of the character at point.

This function is used to co-opt the pointer as a cursor when

REGION should be a rectangle given as (LEFT TOP RIGHT BOT).
`pdf-keynav-pointer-hrelpos` controls at what fraction of the distance between
LEFT and RIGHT the cursor is placed, while `pdf-keynav-pointer-vrelpos` does
the same for BOT and TOP. If both are zero the cursor will be placed at (LEFT,

coordinates are normally relative to the image of a pdf page. This image in
turn might be smaller or larger than the window it is in. In addition, a window
is smaller than a frame. An attempt is made to consider all this. Still, if the

						 min-dy-discrepancy)
  "Returns a list of starting positions of paragraphs on current pdf page.

The starting positions are given in terms of indices in
`pdf-keynav-charlayout'. They are determined heuristically using the
distribution of horizontal and vertical spacing between characters at the
beginning of lines on the page: Anything with larger vertical spacing to the
previous line than the most common spacing between lines (subject to suitable
rounding), or with an indent of reasonable size (symmetric with respect to the
previous and next line), is considered a paragraph start.

DXS-ROUND-TO and DYS-ROUND-TO set the values the horizontal and vertical gaps
between linestarts should be rounded to. The rounded values are then used to
determine frequent values and compare gaps, so the amount of rounding
determines what counts as noise and what is interpreted as meaningful
differences.

MIN-INDENT and MAX-INDENT set the range of horizontal linestart gap sizes that
are interpreted as potential paragraph breaking indents.

MAX-DX-DISCREPANCY sets the maximal allowed discrepancy between the horizontal
linestart gap to the previous and next line for an indent to be considered
symmetric and hence a potential paragraph break (this helps when pages are not
straight).

MIN-DY-DISCREPANCY sets how much larger than the most common vertical linestart
gap a vertical linestart gap has to be before being considered a paragraph
break.

Parameter; default value; unit:
DXS-ROUND-TO; 0.01; in fraction of page width
DYS-ROUND-TO; 0.02; in fraction of page height
MIN-INDENT; 2; in units of DXS-ROUND-TO
MAX-INDENT; 5; in units of DXS-ROUND-TO
MAX-DX-DISCREPANCY; 1; in units of DXS-ROUND-TO
MIN-DY-DISCREPANCY; 1; in units of DYS-ROUND-TO"

Before the copied text is added to the kill ring it is filtered through

The y-coordinate of the (top-left corner of the icon of the) annotation is the
y-coordinate of the top-left boundary of the character at `pdf-keynav-point'.
The x-coordinate is the x-coordinate of the left(right)-most textregion
boundary on the page, minus (plus) `pdf-keynav-annot-text-margin' and the icon
width. The x-coordinate is adjusted if the icon would end up outside the page
image.

ICON and PROPERTY-ALIST are passed on to `pdf-annot-add-text-annotation', which
creates the annotation after the right position has been determined."
